# Manual API Tests

This directory contains manual test scripts for QuizCards API endpoints. These tests are designed to be run during development to verify endpoint functionality.

## Prerequisites

1. Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

2. Ensure you have a Supabase instance running with the correct schema
3. Make sure `SUPABASE_DEFAULT_USER_ID` is set in your `.env` file

## Running Tests

### Test All Endpoints

Run all tests in sequence:

```bash
npm run test:api
```

Or run individual tests:

```bash
npm run test:post:quizzes:generate  # POST /api/quizzes/generate
npm run test:get:quizzes            # GET /api/quizzes
npm run test:get:quizzes:id         # GET /api/quizzes/:id
npm run test:patch:quizzes:id       # PATCH /api/quizzes/:id
npm run test:delete:quiz            # DELETE /api/quizzes/:id
npm run test:get:question           # GET /api/questions/:id
npm run test:patch:question         # PATCH /api/questions/:id
npm run test:delete:question        # DELETE /api/questions/:id
npm run test:regenerate:answers     # POST /api/questions/:id/regenerate
npm run test:patch:answers:id       # PATCH /api/answers/:id
```

## Test Output

Each test script provides colored console output:

- 🧪 Test start
- ✅ Success
- ❌ Failure
- ⚠️ Warning
- 🏁 Test completion

Example output:

```
🧪 Testing GET /api/quizzes endpoint

Test 1: GET /api/quizzes (no filter)
Status: 200
✅ SUCCESS: Got 5 quizzes
   First quiz: "Biology Flashcards" (25 questions)

🏁 Tests completed!
```

## Server Configuration

By default, tests connect to `http://localhost:3000`. If your dev server runs on a different port, update the `BASE_URL` constant in each test file.

```typescript
const BASE_URL = "http://localhost:3000"; // Change this if needed
```

## Database Setup

To test effectively, you should have:

1. At least one quiz in the database (for GET /api/quizzes/:id tests)
2. Mix of draft and published quizzes (for status filtering tests)

You can generate test data by running:

```bash
npx tsx src/test/test-post-quizzes-generate.ts
```

## Troubleshooting

### "No quizzes found in database"

Run the generate-quiz test first to create some test data.

### "Connection refused" or "fetch failed"

Make sure the dev server is running:

```bash
npm run dev
```

### "SUPABASE_DEFAULT_USER_ID not configured"

Add the following to your `.env` file:

```env
SUPABASE_DEFAULT_USER_ID=your-user-id-here
```

## Future Improvements

These manual tests will be replaced with automated integration tests using:

- Vitest for test runner
- Supertest or native fetch for API testing
- Test database for isolated testing
- CI/CD integration

For now, these manual scripts provide quick verification during development.
